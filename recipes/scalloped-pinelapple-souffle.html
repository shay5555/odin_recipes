    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a wonderful pineapple dish to be served with ham. 
        It is a favorite at Easter in my family. 
        The egg whites add a touch of lightness to it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, whites and yolks separated</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups cubed bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. 
            Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg yolks, sugar, butter, and milk together in a large bowl. 
            Stir in the pineapple and bread. 
            Lightly fold egg whites into the pineapple mixture, then spread the mixture into a large baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
